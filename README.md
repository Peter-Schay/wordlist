# Python Demo to make a Sanitized Wordlist

 - iterators
 - parallelism
 - `pathlib.Path`
 - context managers
 - `bytes` and `str` types
 - hanging indent style
 - downloading from https
 - `if __name__ == '__main__'`

### Notes:
 - The _time_ command shows that Python used more CPU (_user_ + _sys_) than _real_ time, which means this used multiple cores.

 - Quixotry is a famous word due to this [record-setting game](https://www.cross-tables.com/annotated.php?a=6517#36#)! ðŸ¤¯

 - Instead of `pathlib`, try `import sys` and `print`:
 ```Python
print(text, file=sys.stderr)  # for diagnostics
print('\n'.join(sanitized))  # for the final list
```
```bash
time python get_sanitized_wordlist.py > sanitized_words.out
```
